My paper title :Soul: An OCTA dataset based on Human Machine Collaborative Annotation Framework

The data includes raw images, corresponding labels, and clinical text information sheets. 

Soul.zip includes six different subsets, each corresponding to a different number of surgeries and follow-up visits, corresponding to the names s1t1, s2t2, etc. Each subset includes the original image and the labels generated by the human-machine collaboration framework. The excel sheet contains two sub-tables, which are patient-level details and individual picture-level details.
